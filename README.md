# Angular DICOM service
This DICOM parser/viewer is an ES5 Javascript library wrapped in an Angular 1.x factory and directive to allow parsing of DICOM P1-10 headers and WebGL/Canvas projection.

**remark** this library replaces the old and less capable [ng-dicom_legacy](https://github.com/Dercetech/ng-dicom_legacy).
